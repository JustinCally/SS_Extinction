abstract: Sexual selection may influence patterns of diversification. Yet their relationship remains unclear with controversy on whether sexual selection leads to a net increase or decrease in speciation rate. Sexual selection is predicted to increase speciation rate as it can facilitate adaptation to new environments by elevating the average fitness of a population. Additionally, sexual selection may work alongide divergent natural selection and swiflty promote reproductive isolation. Here we use sexual dichromatism as a proxy for sexual selection across 5,812 species of passerine birds and a multivariate male-bias measure of sexual selection (sexual dimorphism, polygyny and paternal care) across 2,465 species to investigate the association of sexual selection with speciation and extinction. Importantly, we test whether the effects of sexual selection on speciation are dependent upon ecological pressures such as temperature variability across time and space, primary productivity and range size. Our results from three distinct measures of speciation ($\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$, $\lambda_{BAMM}$) and one measure of extinction ($\mu_{BAMM}$) find that male-bias sexual selection but not sexual dichromatism predicts speciation. Additionally, we find that birds with smaller ranges have higher speciation rates; however the causality of this finding remains inconclusive.

#Introduction xxxxxx

**Process of speciation**: Selection pressures drive speciation. As populations diverge they accumulate genetic and phenotypic changes that ultimately erect barriers against gene flow [@Presgraves_2010; *but see* @Shaw_2011]. In this view populations will speciate and adapt more readily to to new divergent environments if the selection pressures and evolvability of the traits under selection are high. Hence, the rate at which speciation occurs is likely dependent on both the populations adaptive potential/fitness and the evolvability **mmm here it becomes unclear because you are suggesting the link between speciation and the evolvability of traits, but is not clear what you mean by evolvability: a. the potential to evolve (e.g. genetic architecture) b. the rate of trait evolution or c. the magnitud of the difference in a trait between populations. I would either define evolvability earlier or replace the word with something easier to grasp** of phenotypic traits such as morphology or chromatism **color? avoid jargon when possible** [@Rabosky_morph_2013; @Hugall_2012]. Sexual selection is an evolutionary force likely to affect fitness components as well as the evolvability **here I would just use 'evolution' rather than evolvability** of morphological and chromatic traits such as ornaments involved in mating displays or weapons used in male-male competition. It is therefore hypothesised that sexual selection is a key driver of diversification through shifting the rates of adaptation, speciation and extinction.  

**Sexual selection and fitness**: Sexual selection is applied by one sex on the other - more often by females on males [@Fromhage_2016; @Janicke_2016; @Kokko_Jennions2008] and **the strength of sexual selection**can increase or decrease the average fitness of a population; often termed population fitness [*reviewed in*, @Kokko_Brooks_2003; @Whitlock_Agrawal_2009; @Holman_Kokko_2013]. Specifically, in line with the 'good genes' perspective, sexual selection may purge deleterious mutations, [@Agrawal_2001; @Siller_2001] and fixate beneficial mutations in a population [@Whitlock_2000]. Thus, sexual selection is thought to be a key process in mitigating extinction risk and facilitating adaptation. However, **sexual selection can increase the fitness of a population when ** the genotypes under sexual selection (e.g. those that increase male mating/fertilisation success) are genetically positively correlated with traits affecting fitness (e.g. female fecundity or survival). This positive correlation is unlikely to always be the case; regularly, sexual selection favours traits having negative pleiotropic effects on female fitness [@Berger_2014; @Bonduriansky_Chenoweth_2009; @Pennell_2013; @Pischedda_2006]. For instance, in species with high levels of sexual selection mating success becomes more variable and uncertain, thus individuals must heavily invest to increase their chances of successfully reproducing. Through prioritising mating success a sex may invest in costly weaponry and sexual signals, while forgoing strategies that would improve offspring fitness (parental care). This is a potentially costly consequence of sexual selection that affects persistence, adaptation and extinction [@Kokko_Brooks_2003].  

**Sexual selection, heritability and mechanisms of speciation**: Alongside changes to fitness, sexual selection has been proposed to facilitate ecological diversification ***not sure what you mean by this, like specialization in different niches? or generalization?** and speciation through increased evolvability of divergent signals/ornaments associated with improved mating success [@Lande_1981; @Lande_1982]. ** I think a example illustrating the above would be good** Under this model of speciation, divergent sexual signals in one sex (usually males) co-evolve with divergent preferences for those signals in the opposite sex, and by itself sexual selection could lead to behavioural reproductive isolation [@Safran_2013]. But sexual selection is unlikely to be occurring without the effects of natural selection. In this situation, adaptation and speciation may be further enforced if female preferences in mating signals are dually **which are the two?** favoured by natural selection [@Maan_2008]. The extent to which sexually selected traits can evolve is dependent on the underlying genetic variation. Under sexual selection a wider phenotypic space may be available for a population to evolve into than natural selection acting alone, as genetic variation can be maintained under sexual conflict arising from heightened sexual selection [@Lorch_2003; @Bonduriansky_2011; @Radwan_2016]. Furthermore, the evolvability and transmission of fitness and sexually selected traits may vary due to different sex determination systems across taxa. In male homogametic species (ZZ/ZW or ZZ/ZO) --- such as birds --- males are anticipated to have increased heritability of male-specific genotypes on the Z chromosome associated with mating success: such as elaborate ornamentation or plumage coloration [@Hastings_1994; @Reeve_2003]. We might therefore expect birds with higher opportunities for sexual selection to have increased evolvability and speciation rates, especially in environments where natural selection pressures are high and working concordantly to sexual selection. *** I think that sentence needs clarification and a reference, by higher opportunities you mean stronger sex sel? ***

**Environmental interaction**: Importantly, the effects of sexual selection **on?** adaptation and speciation may depend on environmental conditions. Studies suggest that under stressful/changing environments sexual selection may have greater fitness benefits than under benign environments. In stressful environments, the positive correlation between male mating success and female fitness components improves, reducing the burden of negative pleiotropic effects [@Berger_2014; @Connallon_Hall_2016; @Long_2012; @Martinossi-Allibert_Savković_2017]. Conversely, under benign environments environmental stability ensures consistent selection, preferentially removing genetic variation at sexually concordant loci (i.e. loci where the optimum genotype is equivelant for both sexes). In these cases genetic variation preferentially remains at sexually antagonistic loci; causing displacement of male and female traits from their optimum. These predictions would ensue that populations **with stronger sexual selection would have increased fitness and adaptive benefits ** , allowing them to adapt to novel environments [*reviewed in* @Candolin_2008]. Increased environmental variability in a species ecological and climatic niche may also work synergestically with natural selection to promote diverging phenotypic traits **maybe leave out this last sentence? we are not really interested in how nat and sex sel interact to generate phenotypic variation but how combined they can affect speciation** [@Safran_2013]. In certain circumstances sexual selection will reinforce diverging locally adaptated phenotypes through mate choice on phenotypes that advertise quality in a specific ecological context [@Maan_2011]. **any examples?** If mate choice operates on both sexes --- or there is a correlation in trait values between a pair --- assortative mating is likely to strengthen this positive feedback loop and promote population divergence [@Lande_1981]. **maybe mention magic traits? those that are the result of natural selection but end up affecting sexual selection and thus speciation?** Sexual selection may also interact with natural selection in opposing directions when environmental conditions modify the sexually selected signal, such as turbid waters that reduce the signalling strength in sticklebacks [@Wong_2007; @Candolin_2007]. In this opposing view, changing environments may limit the divergence of sexually selected traits and consequently reduce speciation rate.  

**Previous limitations**: The association between sexual selection and speciation has been investigated using many macroevolutionary approaches across various taxa. Importantly, macroevolutionary comparative studies can examine the association between sexual selection and extinction risk in more diverse taxon, over longer evolutionary time-scales and in more natural environments. A meta-analysis of 64 effect sizes from 20 papers found a small, significant **positive?** association between sexual selecetion and speciation [@Kraaijeveld_2011]. However, variation in sexual selection proxies used and other methodological choices (species richness vs rate estimates) led to heterogeneity in effect sizes for the correlation between sexual selection and speciation. Given that species richness and speciation rate are not neccesarily correlated e.g. [@Rabosky_fish_2018] and the recent development and refinement of methodologies in obtaining tip-rate estimates of speciation and extinction [@Jetz_2012; @Rabosky_2014; @Rabosky_diversification_2018] the association between sexual selection and speciation rate is worth revisiting with methods that address several issues that have previously limited macroevolutionary comparative studies. Firstly, sexual selection strength in macroevolutionary studies are often estimated using measures of dimorphism or dichromatism; but these are often partial measures of sexual selection and may not account for the true variation in sexual selection across taxa, which arguably decreases the power to detect an association, especially if phylogenetic signal is strong. Secondlly, many studies use incomplete taxon sampling, with family-level analysis restricted to well sampled avian clades [@Seddon_2008; @Huang_2014]. Thirdly, until recently studies have rarely incorperated extensive bioclimatic predictors into large-scale comparative analyses [*sensu* @Jetz_env_2011; @Pigot_2016]. ** I would give more importance to this one and frame it slightly different: e.g. Until recently studies on the association between sexual selection and speciation have largely ignored the contribution of environmental variables to explain variation in speciation rates. Furthermore, these studies haven't taken into account either the potential interaction between natural and sexual selection in the generation of new species.** Fourthly, phylogenetic uncertainty in the avian tree [@Jetz_2012; *but see* @Rubolini_2015] and uncertainty in tip-rate measures of speciation such as the diversification rate statistic ($\lambda_{DR}$) or node density ($\lambda_{ND}$) [@Rabosky_diversification_2018] as well as speciation and extinction tip-rates from models using BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures) [*see*, @Beaulieu_2015; @Rabosky_Extinction_2016; @Moore_2016; @Rabosky_BAMM_flawed_2017] continue to plague the ability to draw widely accepted findings **I don't know if this is true**.   

**Our study**: We chose to do our study on passerine birds because of the wealth of data available for these (Order: Passeriformes). Recently, @Huang_2014 found no association between sexual dichromatism and speciation using tip-rate estimates from a genetic-only phylogeny [@Jetz_2012] and sexual dichromatism data from a limited spectrophotometry dataset (n = 918) [@Armenta_2008]. Here we assess the relationship between sexual dichromatism, environmental variability and their interaction with three tip-rate measures of speciation and one measure of extinction ($\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$, $\lambda_{BAMM}$ and $\mu_{BAMM}$;) in 5,812 species of passerines. Moreover, we assess the effects of sexual dichromatism measures based on RGB values alongside smaller datasets of sexual dichromatism from spectrophotometry measures (*n* = 581) and male-bias sexual selection measures (*n* = 2,465).**the bit of the sex sel index looks a bit lost in this paragraph but it's quite important, so I'd move it up and bring more attention to it** Using expert range maps and bioclimatic variables we are able to investigate whether the effect of sexual selection on speciation is are dependent on range size, seasonal variation in temperature, spatial temperature variation (across a species' range), long-term variation in temperature between now and the last inter-glacial (LIG) as well net primary productivity (NPP).  


#Materials and methods

We examined the effect of sexual selection on speciation and extinction rate in 97 % of passerines (*n* = 5,812 species; 58 % of all birds). Specifically, we (i) compiled datasets for sexual dichromatism/selection strength and environmental variability, (ii) obtained estimates of speciation and extinction rates across passerines, and (iii) conducted phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS) regressions. Many of the processes undertaken in this study are documented with reproducible code in the electronic supplementary material (ESM).  

##Compiling data for sexual selection and environmental stress

###Sexual dichromatism

We used sexual dichromatism as proxy of sexual selection strength. Male and female plumage scores have previously been measured across 5,983 species of passerines [@Dale_2015]. Briefly, @Dale_2015 obtained sex-specific RGB (red, green and blue) values across six body patches (nape, crown, forhead, throat, upper breast and lower breast) from _Handbook of the Birds of the World_ (volumes 8–16) [@delhoyo2011]. The mean values of red, green and blue were calculated and provided male and female plumage scores. Here we use the absolute difference between males and female RGB scores as an estimate of sexual dichromatism. Additionally, we compiled a colour discriminability measure of sexual dichromatism from spectrophotometer measures [@Armenta_2008]. These measurements include varition in the ultraviolet and bird-visible range and --- unlike the RGB measures --- are sourced from taxanomic samples (as opposed to colour drawings). However, this spectrophotometry data is not as extensive as the RGB measures; with only 581 passerine species available for this analysis. While there is a correlation between these two measures, there is residual variation ($r = 0.79$; **Figure S9**).  

###Male-biased sexual selection

Sexual dichromatism has long been associated with levels of sexual selection [@Darwin_1871], with sexual dichromatism often used as a measure of sexual selection in avian taxa [*e.g.*, @Barraclough_1995; @Seddon_2013; @Morrow_Speciation_2003; @Owens_1999; @Huang_2014]. However, sexual dichromatism is likely to account for only partial variation in sexual selection across taxa. Here we use an existing dataset [@Dale_2015] of male-bias sexual selection based on the first component of a phylogenetic principle component analysis (ppca) of three characteristics associated with sexual selection (sexual size dimorphism, social polygyny and [lack of] paternal care). This measure of male-bias sexual selection is present for only 2,465 species and is weakly correlated with the absolute values for sexual dichromatism using RGB measures ($r = 0.34$; **Figure S10**).  

###Environmental variables 
Using expert range maps [@birdlife_2017] we obtained estimates of species range size. Using these distributions we were able to obtain estimates for extensive climatic conditions that each species is exposed to. Because of taxanomic changes to 1,230 species in the _Birdlife_ database [@delhoyo_2016] we manually matched these taxa with the names used in the sexual dichromatism dataset [@Dale_2015] **was is literally manually? OMG! or do you have a code that does it really well? Can I have it!? :)** . From 1,000 random point samples in each range we extracted 19 present day bioclimatic variables (representing a variety of biologically relevent annual trends in temperature and precipitation) with 30 seconds (~1 km^2^) spatial resultion [@Fick_2017]. From these values we obtained means and standard deviations for each species. Using the same spatial sampling we extracted means and standard deviations of bioclimatic variables from the paleoclimate during the last interglacial (LIG; 120,000 - 140,000 years ago) [@Otto-Bliesner_2006]. Furthermore, to estimate variability in the energy available to species we obtained the mean and standard deviation of net primary productivity (NPP) values between 2000 - 2015 across each species distribution. Estimates of NPP had 30 second resolution and were obtained through MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) primary production products stage 3 (MOD17A3) [@Zhao_2005]. Using this data, which we provide as a potentially useful data resource (see ESM), we generated five predictors of speciation associated with different patterns in environmental variability (see below).  

##Estimating extinction and speciation. 

Phylogenetic information was obtained from www.birdtree.org [@Jetz_2012]. We used a maximum clade credibility tree (MCC) from 2,500 samples of the posterior distribution that were subset to the passerine bird order (*n* = 5,965) as the main phylogentic tree in our comparative analysis. Additionally, a random draw of 100 full trees (including species without genetic data) from the posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees was used for diversification analyses using BAMM. These trees used a 'Hackett backbone' and were constructed using the a pure birth (Yule) model. We calculated three different tip-rate metrics of speciation and one of extinction across all trees.  

Firstly, we obtained two tip-rate metrics of speciation using statistics derived from the properties of the nodes and branches along root-to-tip paths of the phylogeny. Node density (ND) is a simple statistic calculating the density of nodes from the phylogenetic root to the tip, while the log-transformed equal splits (logES), also known as diversification rate (DR) [*e.g.*, @Jetz_2012; @quintero_2018; @Rabosky_fish_2018], is derived from the sum of edge lengths branching from a node, with each more basal node having the sum of lengths down-weighted. Studies have suggested that DR and ND (henceforth referred to as $\lambda_{DR}$ and $\lambda_{ND}$) are more reflective estimates of speciation than diversification [@Belmaker_2015; @Rabosky_diversification_2018]. Therefore, $\lambda_{DR}$ is a measure of speciation rate more heavily weighted to recent speciation events and $\lambda_{ND}$ is a measure of speciation across the root to tip path. These tip-rate measures are alternatives to state-dependent diversification models such as Quantitative State Speciation-Extinction (QuaSSE) models. Based on previous comparisons $\lambda_{DR}$ and $\lambda_{ND}$ are anticipated to achieve high power and low false discovery rate with large phylogenies when incorporated into Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) models [@Harvey_essim_2017].  

Secondly, we used BAMM to model the dynamics of speciation and extinction across the 100 phylogenetic trees [@Rabosky_2014]. This software uses a Bayesian approach (reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to generate a probability distribution of evolutionary regimes with variable speciation and extinction rates. Importantly, these models provide tip-rate estimates of speciation and extinction rate. The parameters of the 100 BAMM runs are detailed in full in the ESM; briefly we used a time-variable model with 100 expected number of shifts and prior rates set from the initial speciation and extinction values using the ``BAMMtools`` R package [@bammtools_2014]. Each BAMM model (one MCC and 100 random draws of the posterior) was run for 100 million generations, and given the computationally intensive nature of BAMM, runs were conducted across multiple CPU's. We obtained effective sample sizes for log-likelihood and number of rate shifts over 200 for each run (Table S3, Table S4). Further details of BAMM parameters and output are available through ESM, with tip-rate means and variances included in the ESM. Additionally, given the variability in BAMM estimates we also provide some analysis of BAMM shift configurations and tip-rate estimates from our run on the MCC tree and within a BAMM run on an MCC from a genetic-only phylogeny across all birds [@Harvey_2017]. All analyses were conducted on log-rates.   

##Statistical analysis

###Generating biologically relevent predictors for environmental variation

Using the extracted environmental variables from each species range size we developed biologically meaningful predictors of environmental variation/stress relating to (i) seasonal climate variation, (ii) spatial climate variation and (iii) long-term climate variation. To obtain seasonal climate variation we used mean values of temperature seasonality (BIO4) for each range. To estimate levels of spatial environmental variation a species may endure we used the first principle component (PC1) from a PCA on standard deviations from all bioclimatic variables, excluding temperature (BIO4) and precipitation seasonality (BIO15). PC1 was heavily loaded towards bioclimatic variables relating to temperature, thus PC1 reflects the variation in temperature across a species' range (**Table S1**). Given that species range is a potentially informative predictor of speciation and extinction we controlled for the correlation between spatial variation and range size --- where larger ranges have larger variation in PC1 --- by taking the residuals of a fitted general additive model (GAM; **Figure S1**). To obtain long-term variation in climates for each species range we take the first principal component of the absolute difference in the bioclimatic variables between the LIG and current values. Similarly to spatial variation, the long-term climate variation is primarily loaded to temperature differences between the LIG and current climates  (**Table S2**, **Figure S2**). Despite similar theoretical underpinnings the predictors of environmental variability used in PGLS analyses are not strongly correlated (**Figure S3**). Details and code to generate these predictors can be found within the ESM.   

###Phylogenetic camparative analysis

To test the association between speciation/extinction and sexual selection, environmental variability and its interaction we used phylogenetic least squares (PGLS) models in the ``nlme`` package [@nlme_2018]. We began by estimating the phylogenetic signal --- Pagel's $\lambda$ [@Pagel_1999] --- using ``corPagel`` in the ``ape`` package [@ape_2004] on a MCC tree. The estimate of $\lambda$ was then fixed for model selection, which was conducted on the same MCC tree drived from 2,500 draws from the posterior distribution [@Jetz_2012]. Model selection used either $\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$, $\lambda_{BAMM}$ or $\mu_{BAMM}$ tip-rate estimates from the MCC (n = 5,812) as the response variable and only compared interaction terms. That is, we fixed the individual predictors of: sexual dichromatism/selection, log-transformed range size, seasonal temperature variation, spatial temperature variation, long-term temperature variation and NPP while comparing 32 models with different combinations of interactions (including none). Model selection was done in ``MuMIn`` using the ``dredge`` function [@MuMIn_2017]. Using the terms from the top-ranking model (lowest AICc) we ran the equivalent model in each of the 100 phylogenetic trees, using the unique response variables and phylogenetic tree correlation structure in each model. This method gave us the ability to present model estimates for an MCC alongside 100 random draws; acknowledging the potential role phylogenetic uncertainty has in tapering conclusions drawn from a random sample of the data. This method was conducted on models that used data from all available passerine species (*n* = 5,812). The same proceedure decribed above was applied to a subset dataset of passerine birds (*n* = 581), where sexual dichromatism measures were sourced from spectrophotometry measures [@Armenta_2008] and where male-bias sexual selection ppca was used as a predictor instead of sexual dichromatism (*n* = 2,465). Finally, using this data subsetted for species with measurements of male-bias sexual selection we conducted a phylogenetic path analysis using the ``phylopath`` ``R`` package [@Wouter_2018]. The phylogenetic path analysis was used to assess causal paths between variables not able to be modelled within the univariate response of PGLS.**which tree did you use for this? or the 100 trees?** To minimise path complexity we use temperature seasonality (BIO4) as the single measure for environmental variability and use $\lambda_{DR}$ as the single measure of speciation. Further details of the path analysis including reasons for path directions can be found within the ESM along with all other analyses and the relevant ``R`` code to reproduce results.

##Effects of sexual dichromatism/selection on speciation are not dependent upon environmental variability

PGLS models with interaction terms between the respective measure of sexual dichromatism/selection and the five measures of environmental variability (seasonal temperature variation, log-range size, long-term temperature variation, spatial temperature variation and NPP) were included in global models **in the top you say you chose the top ranking model but you refer here to the global, not sure what you mean by global**. However, in all model selection phases for different measure of speciation ($\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$, $\lambda_{BAMM}$) and different measures of sexual selection (RGB values, spectrophotometry and male-biased sexual selection) no interaction terms were significant or present in the top models ($\delta$ AICc > 4; **Table S5**, **Table S6**, **Table S10**, **Table S13**). Hence we find no evidence that the effect of sexual selection on speciation or extinction is dependent upon certain environmental conditions. Furthermore, we find no support for these individual bioclimatic factors (seasonal temperature variation, long-term temperature variation, spatial temperature variation and NPP) acting as a driver of speciation independently from sexual dichromatism/selection (\autoref{model_results}, **Figure S10**).   

##No evidence that sexual dichromatism affects speciation

We found no evidence that species with increased sexual dichromatism have higher or lower rates of speciation. Using three response measures of speciation ($\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$, $\lambda_{BAMM}$), the effect of sexual dichromatism was not significant in any PGLS model based on tip-rate estimates and correlation structures from a MCC tree. Specifically, sexual dichromatism showed no association with $\lambda_{DR}$ ($\beta$ = `r formatC(MCC.DR.top[["coefficients"]][["SDi"]], format = "e", digits = 3)`, p = `r round(anova(MCC.DR.top)[["SDi","p-value"]], digits = 3)`; \autoref{model_results}a, \autoref{Speciation_Figure}a) or $\lambda_{ND}$ ($\beta$ = `r formatC(MCC.ND.top[["coefficients"]][["SDi"]], format = "e", digits = 3)`, p = `r round(anova(MCC.ND.top)[["SDi","p-value"]], digits = 3)`; \autoref{model_results}a). Furthermore, speciation rates from BAMM ($\lambda_{BAMM}$) were also unaffected by sexual dichromatism ($\beta$ = `r formatC(MCC.Lambda.top[["coefficients"]][["SDi"]], format = "e", digits = 3)`, p = `r round(anova(MCC.Lambda.top)[["SDi","p-value"]], digits = 3)`; \autoref{model_results}a). PGLS analyses using subsetted data (n = 581), where sexual dichromatism was measured using spectrophotometry distance measures [@Armenta_2008] yielded results concordant to the full data set; that is, no association between sexual dichromatism and speciation or extinction (**Figure S10**). Our results from MCC models are largely corroborated by model estimates from PGLS analyses of the rates and correlation structures from 100 random trees. Model estimates are normally distributed around zero when using complete taxon sampling models and RGB measures of sexual dichromatism (\autoref{model_results}a, See HPD intervals in **Table S8**). For PGLS using the subsetted dataset where sexual dichromatism was determined with spectrophotmetry [@Armenta_2008] the estimates from the 100 trees in the $\lambda_{DR}$ models are positively skewed (`r formatC(Armenta.hpd.DR.top$Colour.discriminability, format = "e", digits = 3)`) but normally distributed around zero for $\lambda_{ND}$ and $\lambda_{BAMM}$ (**Table S12**).  

##Male-bias sexual selection increases speciation

When we conducted PGLS analysis using data subsetted for values of sexual selection estimated from a phylogenetic PCA of sexual dimorphism, social polygyny and paternal care (*n* = 2,465) there was a significant positive association between sexual selection and $\lambda_{DR}$ ($\beta$ = `r formatC(Subset.MCC.DR.top[["coefficients"]][["Sexual_selection_ppca"]], format = "e", digits = 3)`, p = `r round(anova(Subset.MCC.DR.top)[["Sexual_selection_ppca","p-value"]], digits = 3)`; \autoref{model_results}b) and a non-significant positive association between sexual selection and $\lambda_{ND}$ ($\beta$ = `r formatC(Subset.MCC.ND.top[["coefficients"]][["Sexual_selection_ppca"]], format = "e", digits = 3)`, p = `r round(anova(Subset.MCC.ND.top)[["Sexual_selection_ppca","p-value"]], digits = 3)`; \autoref{model_results}b). However, no association was found between sexual selection and $\lambda_{BAMM}$ ($\beta$ = `r formatC(Subset.MCC.Lambda.top[["coefficients"]][["Sexual_selection_ppca"]], format = "e", digits = 3)`, p = `r round(anova(Subset.MCC.Lambda.top)[["Sexual_selection_ppca","p-value"]], digits = 3)`; \autoref{model_results}b). ** here I would say the same for ND and bamm, either that they are positive but non sig nificant or that they show no trend** For PGLS models on 100 random trees, we find the distribution to be similar to the estimates when an MCC tree is used. Among the 100 tress we find a positive association between sexual selection and $\lambda_{DR}$ (HPD Interval = `r formatC(Subset.hpd.DR.top$Sexual_selection_ppca, format = "e", digits = 3)`), and a positive (but less so) association between sexual selection and $\lambda_{ND}$ (HPD Interval = `r formatC(Subset.hpd.ND.top$Sexual_selection_ppca, format = "e", digits = 3)`; ) as well as $\lambda_{BAMM}$ (HPD Interval = `r formatC(Subset.hpd.Lambda.top$Sexual_selection_ppca, format = "e", digits = 3)`). Complete HPD intervals for models using male-bias sexual selection ppca as a predictor can be found within **Table S15**.  


##Species with smaller ranges have increased rates of speciation

Based on $\lambda_{DR}$ and $\lambda_{ND}$ tip-rate metrics of speciation we find a negative association between range size and speciation; that is, species with smaller ranges show marginally higher values for $\lambda_{DR}$ and $\lambda_{ND}$. Model estimates from PGLS models using an MCC tree for determining tip-rates and correlation structures place this negative association as small but significant ($\lambda_{DR}$: $\beta$ = `r formatC(MCC.DR.top[["coefficients"]][["log(range.size.m2)"]], format = "e", digits = 3)`, p = `r round(anova(MCC.DR.top)[["log(range.size.m2)","p-value"]], digits = 3)`; $\lambda_{ND}$: $\beta$ = `r formatC(MCC.ND.top[["coefficients"]][["log(range.size.m2)"]], format = "e", digits = 3)`, p = `r round(anova(MCC.ND.top)[["log(range.size.m2)","p-value"]], digits = 3)`; \autoref{model_results}a, \autoref{Speciation_Figure}a). This association was also evident across the estimates from models using the 100 trees ($\lambda_{DR}$: HPD Interval = `r formatC(hpd.DR.top[[2]], format = "e", digits = 3)`; $\lambda_{ND}$: HPD Interval = `r formatC(hpd.ND.top[[2]], format = "e", digits = 3)`; \autoref{model_results}a). Subsetted models with reduced sample size and different measures of sexual selection --- but the same measure of range size --- show variable evidence that range size is negatively associated with speciation. Data subsetted based on the sexual selection ppca (*n* = 2,465) show that smaller range size significantly predicted increased $\lambda_{DR}$ (\autoref{model_results}b), yet this negative association was not significant for $\lambda_{ND}$ and near-zero for $\lambda_{BAMM}$. Alternatively, models using subsetted data (*n* = 581), where sexual dichromatism was measured using spectrophotometry distance measures [@Armenta_2008] gave non-significant estimates for the effect of range size on all measures of speciation (**Figure S10, Table S11, Table S2**). Because the range size dataset is the same across the three data subsets we draw our conclusions from the models with highest power using near-complete taxon sampling (*n* = 5,812).   

##Phylogenetic path analysis

Using a phylogenetic path analysis we found there to be multiple significant paths between variables used in the PGLS (\autoref{Path_Analysis}; **Figure S13**). Notably, environmental variability (temperature seasonality) directly affected sexual dichromatism ($\beta$ = `r round(best_model[["coef"]][1,4], digits = 2)`) and the path from sexual selection to sexual dichromatism was relatively weak given the expectations of dichromatism being a well utilised proxy of sexual selection ($\beta$ = `r round(best_model[["coef"]][2,4], digits = 2)`). Additionally, given the large direct effect of temperature seasonality on range size ($\beta$ = `r round(best_model[["coef"]][1,3], digits = 2)`) and our findings from the PGLS that range size is negatively associated with $\lambda_{DR}$, there is an indirect effect of temperature seasonality on $\lambda_{DR}$ ($\beta$ = `r round(best_model[["coef"]][1,3]*best_model[["coef"]][3,5], digits = 2)`; \autoref{Path_Analysis}).  

##Extinction rate

We found no evidence that extinction ($\mu_{BAMM}$) was impacted by the extent of sexual dichromatism for full-taxon sampling ($\beta$ = `r formatC(MCC.Mu.top[["coefficients"]][["SDi"]], format = "e", digits = 3)`, p = `r round(anova(MCC.Mu.top)[["SDi","p-value"]], digits = 3)`; \autoref{model_results}a). This null result was consistent for spectrophotometry measures of sexual dichromatism (**FigureS10, Table S11, Table S12**) and for the estimates of sexual selection using the sexual selection ppca (\autoref{model_results}, **Table S14, Table S15**).  


##Variability across trees and methods

We tested our hypothesis that sexual selection is associated with speciation using several methods and across 100 samples of phylogentic trees drawn from the post burn-in posterior [@Jetz_2012]. The range of methods utilised were implemented to overcome uncertainty in the power and precision of various tip-rate estimates as well as the variation between trees. We found that that the tip-rate estimates across the 100 trees were quite variable for both $\lambda_{DR}$ and $\lambda_{BAMM}$ (**Figure S13**). Despite this variation, both methods provided similar estimates for speciation in each species for the mean values across the 100 trees ($r = 0.67$) and for the tip-rate estimates from the MCC ($r = 0.68$). However in comparison to $\lambda_{DR}$, the value of $\lambda_{BAMM}$ was the _mean_ drawn from a posterior distribution (*n* = 1,000) of BAMM generations, thus estimates of $\lambda_{BAMM}$ (and $\mu_{BAMM}$) have an added level of variation. To account for this variation, weights (using the inverse of the variance) were used for the PGLS models. From 1000 posterior samples of the MCC BAMM run the coefficient of variation (CV) for all log-rates of $\lambda_{BAMM}$ was relatively low (*mean CV* = `r round(mean(MCC.BAMM.df$CV.lambda), digits = 2)`, *median CV* = `r round(median(MCC.BAMM.df$CV.lambda), digits = 2)` ; *see* **Figures S5 and S7**). Despite the convergence of the BAMM model in all runs --- where effective sample sizes of the number of shifts and log-likelihood were all greater than 200 (**Table S3 and S4**) --- we found that the unique combinations of rate shifts across the large phylogenetic tree (n = 5,966 species) was high. This means that although the number of rate shifts reached convergence and is more precise ($median = 59$; **Figure S6**) the locations of the rate shifts (*i.e.* the credible shift set) across the tree is highly heterogeneous. The variability in the locations for the shift configurations is a likely source of uncertainty in downstream tip-rates used as the response variable in PGLS models. Notably the model estimate BAMM produced varied a lot between trees relative to the confidence interval of the MCC tree, with 95 % HPD interval being approximately 20-fold wider than the MCC 95 % CI for models using BAMM, whereas for $\lambda_{DR}$ and $\lambda_{ND}$ the HPD 95 % interval width was equal to or less than the MCC 95 % CI (\autoref{model_results}, **Table S9**).

Both datasets were used for anlyses with three measures of speciation $\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$, $\lambda_{BAMM}$ and one measure of extinction $\mu_{BAMM}$ as response variables. When using $\lambda_{DR}$ and $\lambda_{ND}$ as the response variable, they provide relatively congruent results; **no need to detail the results in the legend**with a negative relationship between $\lambda_{DR/ND}$ and range size as well as a positive relationship between $\lambda_{DR/ND}$ and sexual selection (**b**). Alternatively, when using $\lambda_{BAMM}$ and $\mu_{BAMM}$ the model estimates are more variable across trees compared to the MCC estimate, which do not significantly differ from zero. The numerical values for the model estimates using the MCC tree and hpd of estimates from 100 random trees can be found within the ESM.

#Discussion

We found no evidence that sexual dichromatism alters the rate of speciation in passerine birds independently or via interactions with environmental variability. This result is consistent across different measures of speciation ($\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$ and $\lambda_{BAMM}$) and two measures of dichromatism (spectral and RGB). However, we did find that when using a male-bias measure of sexual selection --- instead of sexual dichromatism --- there was a positive association with speciation: with significance varying across different rate estimates. Our findings suggest that the components that were used in the ppca of male-bias sexual selection (sexual size dimorphism, social polygyny and [lack of] paternal care) are better predictors of speciation than sexual dichromatism and provide discussion points for the contentious topic of sexual selection proxies. No bioclimatic measures of environmental variability (temperature seasonality, long-term temperature variation and spatial temperature variation) predicted speciation, but range size was negatively associated with two measures of speciation ($\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$). This finding suggests that species with smaller range sizes have increased speciation rate. However, small range size may be a cause or effect of speciation rate and potentially even an artifact of taxonomic classification. Interestingly we found a discrepancy in the model results obtained from tip-rate statistics ($\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$) and those using tip-rate estimates from a model based approach ($\lambda_{BAMM}$); whereby BAMM produced precise null results for associations between predictors and speciation as well as extinction. 

Despite the association between sexual selection and sexual dichromatism in passerine birds [@Dale_2015] we find that sexual dichromatism does not predict speciation rate as sexual selection does. The association between sexual selection and sexual dichromatism in birds is a Darwinian trope [@Darwin_1871] that allows it to be commonly used as a proxy for sexual selection in comparative studies [*e.g.*, @Barraclough_1995; @Seddon_2013; @Morrow_Speciation_2003; @Owens_1999; @Huang_2014]. However, the presence of high sexual dichromatism in bird species may be also dependent on ecological selection pressures. Ecological pressures could drive sexual dichromatism in the absence of mate choice if sex-specific niches provide opportunity for the evolution of sex-limited traits [@Kottler_1980; @Slatkin_1984; @Shine_1989]. In damselflies, differences between the sexes in their exposure to UV radiation drives dichromatism between the sexes [@Cooper_2010; @Punzalan_2010]. Ecological impacts on sexual dichromatism are supported by our path analysis; which reveals that sexual dichromatism is positively affected by temperature seasonality (a measure of environmental variation) albeit by a relatively small amount. Given that our results show that speciation rate increases with sexual selection strength, but not sexual dichromatism, we are led to conclude that sexual dichromatism is a seemingly poor proxy of sexual selection and that the noise associated with the proxy measurement of sexual selection cancels out the obtained signal; this is despite the high power of our comparative study. The usefulness of sexual dichromatism as a proxy of sexual selection may be dependent upon the metabolic pathways that give rise to plumage colouration; with not all plumage colouration reflecting mate quality. A recent meta-analysis found that converted carotenoids (but not those sourced from diet) predict mate quality through improvements in parasite resistance and reproductive success [@Weaver_2018]. Given the importance of honest signalling in sexual selection and the variability in colour production across birds, sexual dichromatism in many species may unreliable measure of mate quality for female birds and sexual selection for researchers.**Great paragraph!!**   

In-line with predictions and a previous meta-analysis [@Kraaijeveld_2011] we find male-bias sexual selection marginally increases speciation rate (at least for $\lambda_{DR}$, $\lambda_{ND}$) yet there is no direct evidence of this association being dependent on variable or stressful environments; albeit a phylogenetic path analysis shows an indirect effect of environmental variability (through range size). When evolving under stressful conditions, sexually antagonistic selection is hypothesised to be weakened relative to selection that is conchordant between the sexes [@Connallon_SA_2015; @Connallon_Hall_2016]. While these predictions are supported in several lab (experimental evolution) studies [@Long_2012; @Berger_2014; @Punzalan_2013], other studies have not found the association [@Delcourt_2009; @Martinossi-Allibert_Savković_2017; @Holman_Jacomb_2017]. Given that we did not detect an effect of environmental variability (by itself or as an interaction with sexual selection) we are left with several possible explanations. Firstly, the effects of sexual selection on adaptation and thus speciation may depend on the type of environmental variability the species is evolving under. Specifically, sexual antagonism may be more easily purged in environments where directional environment pressures are maintained; whereas when environmental variability is cyclical (e.g. seasonal or glacial climate cycles) sexual antagonism can remain indefinitely as a fitness burden [@Connallon_Hall_2016]. Secondly, the environmental predictors used here may not account for the key ecological forces/natural selection pressures that interact with sexual selection to drive speciation. Specifically, access to dietary resources, and the impacts of predation or parasitism are unaccounted for here: arguably these are key processes affecting sexual selection and speciation [*reviewed in*, @Maan_2011]. Thirdly, it is also likely that there is no effect; at least not in the species investigated here.   

<!-- **Make it about evolvability** -->
<!-- The effects of sexual selection are complex and are expected to vary amongst taxa. Although birds have a sex determination system conducive to increased father-to-son heritability of male-specific fitness traits on the Z chromosome [@Hastings_1994; @Reeve_2003] there are counteravailing arguments suggesting that deleterious recessive alleles on the Z chromosome in males (ZZ) are less exposed to selection, thus limiting the evolvability of traits [@Charlesworth_1987; @Charlesworth_2018]. In a macro-evolutionary meta-analysis on sexual selection and speciation rate @Kraaijeveld_2011 found no significant taxon based differences across a diverse sample of vertebrates and invertebrates (fish, insects, birds, spiders, reptiles, mammals). Yet sexual selection in male homogametic taxa (birds) produced noticibly faster speciation rates than in male heterogametic taxa **Would be good to get raw data off them and do a pair-wise comparison**. The evolvability of the   -->


The most consistent finding uncovered in this comparative analysis is that smaller range sizes are associated with increased speciation rates. But drawing conclusions from this finding is fraught with challenges. Challenges arise on determining the causality of range size and speciation; as arguably small range size could either be a cause or effect of speciation. ** In the next sentence I would start the opposite way, as the model was framed with range affecting speciation instead of the opossite**High speciation rate may lead to smaller range sizes as niche filling by recently diverged species will suppress the expansion of newly speciated taxa. Within Himalayan songbirds range expansions are prevented by the competition for resources by related species [@Price_2014]; however this limitation on range expansion is then expected to prevent future speciation events [@Rosenzweig_1995; @Weir_2011]. Thus, if range size is a cause of speciation we might expect it to be smaller but
if it is a predictor of speciation it arguably should be larger; with greater opportunities for geographic barriers to form in larger ranges [@Rosenzweig_1995]. 
** this one is tricky, because yes, what you say above can be true, but also: species with larges ranges mean they have less limits to dispersal, with less restrictions on gene flow and thus lower speciation rates. range size can affect speciation rates just because is a proxy for dispersal abilities or something like that. The thing is that range size is probably the result of many processes**

Unlike Himalayan songbirds, species undergoing adaptive radiation in new niches are unlikely to be limited by competition for resources from pre-existing taxa. Across islands we expect to see a correlation between speciation and small range size, not because of any inherent properties of the range size, rather that they reflect newly formed islands with empty niches **This seems like a very established idea but not sure whose it is**. Thus our findings may be heavily dependent on species whose range size is restricted to a single island within an archipelago (*e.g.*, *Geospiza* sp.; aka Darwin's finches). Birds with large range sizes are also predicted to have greater dispersal ability; in these cases individuals may be more able to overcome geographical barriers and maintain gene flow; thus lowering speciation in these wide-ranging species [@Birand_2012; @Claramunt_2012]. **ok, so yeah, like i said, maybe move this to where I mentioned it earlier**Several studies have used morphological measures of wing shape, a proxy for dispersal ability (Hand-wing index/ Kipp's distance), as a predictor of speciation and coexistence [*e.g.*, @Kennedy_2016; @Pigot_2016], but these measurements across passerines is not yet extensive **I think? ~ 1000**. One further explanation for the negative association between range size and sexual dichromatism/sexual selection is the potential bias of taxonomic classification whereby splitting of subspecies into species in clades with large ranges leads to increased recent phylogenetic branching as well as a more subdivided range **Has this argument been articulated?** **I can't remember reading it, maybe is not true and I made it up haha. Makes sense to me but maybe good to see what reviewers would think about it.  I guess it would also depend on whether the taxa with large ranges are considered the same species because there is actually no strong genetic differentiation across the range and not because there isn't enough information (e.g.sampling) to split a species with massive range into smaller ranges and more species** . The role of range size in speciation may be further investigated through ancestral geographic range reconstruction [@Quintero_2015], as ancestral ranges may be beneficial in understanding modes of speciation and the causality of range size expansions and contractions [@Losos_2003].   

Here we used BAMM to calculate extinction rates across passerines and test whether these rates were associated with sexual dichromatism/selection or various ecological variables. We found no associations in this respect despite the wealth of theoretical predictions on the effects of sexual selection on fitness. Extinction is notoriously difficult to obtain accurate estimates for in comparative studies **Cite papers, e.g. Rabosky: 'Extinction rates should not be estimated from molecular phylogenies'**, as it is a process that occurs over millennia, leaving scant traces. One exception to this comes from fossil ostracods, a group of marine invertebrates. In these species there is an extensive fossil record of extinct ostracods from the Late Cretaceous epoch (84–66 million years ago) as well as identifiable sexual dimorphism. Recently, @Martins_2018 found that species of ostracods with larger sexual dimorphism (representing larger investment by males in reproductive organs) had higher extinction rates; suggesting that sexual selection increases extinction risk. Other comparative studies have assessed the relationship between sexual selection and extinction in birds (@Doherty_2003; @Mitra_1996; @Morrow_2003) and mammals [@Bro-Jorgensen_2014; @Morrow_2004] without consensus. Yet these methods often rely on extinction threat status from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List [*e.g.*, @Morrow_2003; @Bro-Jorgensen_2014; @Morrow_2004] and may be heavily biased to species under greater anthropogenic threat, culturally valued or well researched. While estimating extinction risk from the phylogeny may not come with these biases, they are riddled with others [*reviewed in*, @Pyron_2016]. BAMM has been subject to controversy in its ability to model rate shifts and extinction rates [*see*, @Beaulieu_2015; @Rabosky_Extinction_2016; @Moore_2016; @Rabosky_BAMM_flawed_2017], and while several tip-rate estimates exist for speciation (*e.g.*, $\lambda_{DR}$ and $\lambda_{ND}$) extinction estimates are not as easily obtained. Here we anticipated extinction rates would be underestimated because we used a phylogeny constructed with a birth-only (Yule) model [@Jetz_2012]. Given these underestimates of $\mu_{BAMM}$ it is likely we failed to detect true associations between sexual dichromatism/selection and extinction. The power of BAMM as a model based-approach in estimating $\lambda$ and $\mu$ is dependent size of the rate regimes. BAMM often produces homogeneous $\lambda_{BAMM}$ and $\mu_{BAMM}$ for clades with few rate shifts, whereas $\lambda_{DR}$ produces higher heterogeneity in tip-rates; arguably this could reflect increased power or sampling error [@Rabosky_BAMM_flawed_2017; @Rabosky_diversification_2018]. Thus we are somewhat uncertain in the validity of conclusions from $\mu_{BAMM}$ estimates as well as $\lambda_{BAMM}$ and $\lambda_{DR}$ given their discrepancy.  

Improvements in estimating tip-rates of speciation in the last few years has allowed us to revisit the association between sexual selection and speciation. With high power and alongside extensive ecological predictors we find that male-bias measures of sexual selection better predict speciation than sexual dichromatism. If sexual selection promotes speciation through improvements in fitness and adaptation the implications are manifold with sexual selection a potentially valuable utility in conservation [*reviewed in*, @Holman_Kokko_2013] and captive breeding programs for threatened species [*reviewed in*, @Charge_2014]. Additionally, our finding that high speciation rate is associated with smaller range size has pronounced significance to the future survival of these rapidly speciating species in a world with increased habitat loss and anthropogenic stress. Range size is the best predictor of extinction risk [@Harris_2008] and the association found here ensues that many newly speciated clades may be at greater risk of extinction due to anthropogenic effects if not evolutionary or ecological effects.  


<!-- Despite the strong predictions that sexual selection is more likely to increase speciation than not **cite all those paper**, there are countervailing arguments that sexual selection may dampen speciation rate. Studies have suggested that increased selection on males through sexual selection may elevate inter-population mating rates as males seek to overcome local gene flow between populations and impede speciation [@Parker_1998; @Servedio_2014]. **How?** Sexual selection may also lead to the evolution of traits that constrain further divergence or adaptation (i.e. lead to an evolutionary dead end) **CITE**. -->
